Saddlebred Blog

This project is a peek into a lifelong passion of mine. Not just horses, but the American Saddlebred. I started riding when I was ten years old. My first lesson came free, thanks to a tear off coupon posted on the wall of a QuikStop Oilube. That particular chain of oil change shops in the Greater Cincinnati area was owned by a family that kept horses with the trainer who offered the free lesson the coupon advertised. All it took was one, I was hooked for life.

The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features of this project are as follows:

Two media queries for large and medium/small screens.<br>

Over 20 commits.<br>
An HTML form that saves to a Google Sheet.<br>
A conversion tool that converts inches into hands, the unit horse height is measured with.<br>
A countdown clock to the World's Championship Horse Show.<br>
A JavaScript graph for the leading sires at the WCHS in 2020.<br>

The Apps Script feature under Extensions shows the Google side code for the submit form to sheet. In the event that's inaccessible, a screen shot titled sheet code can be found in this repo.
